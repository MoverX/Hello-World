# Hello-World
Notes for Nick
I am 72 years old and my hobby is radio ham. Got licence only a few years ago, but took the exam in 1972!  Never got into any form of programming seriously, but my first project, is just to put together existing building blocks to use a raspberry pi 2, with funcubedonglepro+ remotely, as a receiver for ham bands - principally (maybe only) top band, using a beverage antenna. Not sure at this stage what s/w to use, but I put Noobs on the pi, then installed GQRX. Already problems, but that will be covered in a specific file.
